# AstroDo – Your Cosmic To-Do List 🌌

[Live Demo 🌍](https://astrodo.netlify.app/)

AstroDo is a cosmic-themed to-do list web app designed to help you manage your daily tasks with a touch of the stars. Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this lightweight app offers a sleek, responsive interface and smooth user experience without any frameworks or external libraries.

You can add, mark, and delete tasks, with helpful notifications that guide you if something’s missing, duplicated, or too long. Your tasks are stored automatically using `localStorage`, so they stay saved even after you refresh the page. The interface is optimized for mobile and desktop, and the theme is inspired by the beauty of space — making productivity feel a little more magical. ✨
